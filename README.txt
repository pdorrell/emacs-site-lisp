This project consists of my personal GNU Emacs site-lisp directory.

It may or may not be useful to anyone else, but it is designed
so that it will hopefully run as is on any computer with GNU Emacs 23.2
installed. (Currently it runs on both Microsoft Windows Vista and Ubuntu.)

It includes the following files by other authors:
* html-helper-mode (v 3.0.4kilo)
* nxml-mode (version 20041004)
* haxe-mode

Note: other files authored by me may have their own less restrictive
licences which apply to those files individually.
