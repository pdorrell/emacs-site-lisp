;; Standard GNU emacs contains two main functions that help with
;; editing accented non-English languages -

;; standard-european, which is used here, to display higher characters
;; as accented characters

;; iso-accents-mode, which allows one to use keys `'"^/~ as special
;; accent keys to compose accented characters

;; In Spanish, the following is almost true -
;; For every accented or non-ASCII character, there is one
;; corresponding ASCII character, and no ASCII character has more
;; than one corresponding non-ASCII character. The exceptions are
;; the raised a and o's use with ordinal numbers.
;; spanish-minor-mode defines two toggle keys (here set to be F2 and F3)
;; F3 toggles a and o to the ordinal endings, F2 toggles all other
;; possibilities with characters AaEeIiNnOoUu!?
;; F2 and F3 toggle the characters preceding the cursor, i.e. the 
;; character just types, So to type ¿ Como estás ?, type -
;; ? F2 (space) C o m o (space) e s t a F2 s ?
;; It is also easy to add accents to text previously typed without
;; accents.

;; To make this mode accessible, add the following lines (uncommented)
;; to your _emacs file or to "site-lisp/default.el" -

;;(autoload 'spanish-minor-mode "spanish")
;;(global-set-key [?\M-\C-S] 'spanish-minor-mode)

;; Shift-Meta-Control S will then toggle spanish-minor-mode
;; (= Shift-Alt-Control S on Win 95/NT)
